[log in to aws](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1), navigate to our [cloudfront distribution](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home?region=us-east-1#distribution-settings:E3K69I05FW71HX), and create an invalidaton with the any of the following object paths (depending on what you changed):

```
/index.html
/assets/*
/bundle.js
```

if any new routes were added to `./app/index.js`, after the invalidation is complete, use [botmap.io](http://botmap.io/) to generate a new `sitemap.xml` file for https://goodcall.nyc. Download that file into the root directory of this repository.

finally, deploy again, and create another invalidation with the following object path:

```
/sitemap.xml
```
