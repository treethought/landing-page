          If you don't have a private lawyer to call, which most of us don't, it is hard to know what to do if youâ€™ve been arrested. Without a cell phone, and only a few free calls from a precinct, it is difficult at best to reach the help you need. Our mission is to make the arrest process less painful and harmful for those that are detained and their loved ones. We strive to make this process more transparent and just for all New Yorkers regardless of income.
