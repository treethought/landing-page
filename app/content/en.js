      text: 'Our four founders met through <a class="about-page__paragraph-link" href="https://labs.robinhood.org/">Blue Ridge Labs @ Robin Hood</a>, a social impact incubator aimed at building technology to address problems faced by low income New Yorkers. During our research, we heard stories from dozens of New Yorkers who were arrested for trivial reasons like hopping a turnstile, forgetting to pay a ticket, or simply "fitting the description". With their cell phones taken away, their only way to reach out for help was a few phone calls on an old dial-pad phone, to numbers they had to have memorized. It was difficult for them to reach their loved ones and nearly impossible to reach a lawyer. Their inability to get help in this critical moment often times lead to devastating outcomes, including getting fired from their jobs, being wrongfully sent to jail for weeks on end, and admitting to crimes they didn\'t commit. <br /> <br /> We founded Good Call to provide better support throughout the arrest process, with the mission of ensuring that everyone who gets arrested has a fair process and a just outcome, and isn\'t punished because of what they look like, where they live, or how much money they have. In October of 2016, we launched our pilot with legal support being provided by <a class="about-page__paragraph-link" href="http://www.bronxdefenders.org/">The Bronx Defenders</a>, one of the most prestigious legal service providers in the country. Our goal is to bring Good Call to all of New York City and beyond.'

        header: '“Good Call” Hotline Launches In The Bronx To Provide Better Legal Support During Arrest',
        content: `
          <p><strong>NEW YORK CITY - October 14, 2016</strong> - Good Call, a product of Blue Ridge Labs’ social impact incubator program, launched a free hotline today to improve legal support for people who are arrested in the Bronx. The hotline, 347-95-BRONX, can be called by anyone who is arrested in the Bronx or their loved ones, to receive advice and give a lawyer more time to look into their case. Today, detainees don’t get a chance to speak with a lawyer until a brief meeting shortly before their arraignment.</p>
          <p>“We are both excited and humbled to bring this service to the Bronx”, said Gabe Leader-Rose, co-founder of Good Call. “Over the past few months, we’ve heard hundreds of accounts of people in our city being arrested for trivial reasons and paying an unacceptable price. We know there are much larger systemic issues in the criminal justice system and policing practices than we are able to address, but we hope that Good Call will help the community push back against injustice.”</p>
          <p>When arrested, all of a person’s belongings are confiscated before they are allowed to make a phone call on a traditional dial pad phone. In the age of smartphones, with less of us memorizing phone numbers, this can make it very difficult for someone to reach the people they need. To combat this issue, Good Call runs a website, goodcall.nyc, where users can signup and list emergency contacts to alert in case of their arrest - no memorization required. Good Call is partnering with reputable Legal Service Providers in the Bronx to staff intake operators and lawyers for the hotline, looking to help the subjects of roughly 40,000 arrests that happen in the Bronx each year. If the hotline is a success in the Bronx, Good Call plans to expand to the remaining four boroughs, and make the arrest process more fair for all New Yorkers, regardless of income.</p>
